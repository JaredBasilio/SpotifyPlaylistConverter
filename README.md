# Spotify Playlist Converter
`Spotify Playlist Converter` is a scrapped project using React, Bootstrap, and the Spotify Web API. The goal of the project was to find the youtube equivalences of songs in a Spotify playlist and making a playlist with each of the closest songs. Youtube API does not allow that many requests for songs with many results so I put this project on hold until I find an alternative method.
## Install
Navigate to server folder and run:

`npm run devStart`

Navigate to client folder and run:

`npm start`

## TODO
- [ ] Find alternative to Youtube API

- [ ] Give theme similar to Spotify's main theme

- [ ] Allow a taskbar for your playlists

- [ ] Fix edge cases that Spotify API can't handle (local songs, songs without equivalences, removed Spotify songs etc.)
